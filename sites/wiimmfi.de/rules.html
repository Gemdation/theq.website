<h1>Wiimmfi Rule Booklet</h1>
<p>Wiimmfi enforces a tiered system of bans comprising eight distinct durations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3-Minute Ban</li>
    <li>1-Hour Ban
    <li>6-Hour Ban</li>
    <li>24-Hour Ban</li>
    <li>1-Week Ban</li>
    <li>2-Week Ban</li>
    <li>4-Week Ban</li>
    <li>Permanent Ban</li>
</ul>
<p>For each transgression, a first offense incurs a specific base ban duration. In the event of a subsequent offense, the ban duration escalates to the next higher tier. It is important to note that these regulations are specifically tailored to Mario Kart Wii, given its status as the most prevalent game on Wiimmfi. However, similar principles may apply to other supported games.</p>
<p>To report individuals who violate the established rules, please proceed to post a comment in the current About banning thread in the following forum board, making sure you provide enough proof and information:<br>
    <a>https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Board/357-Wiimmfi-English</a><br>
    Alternatively, if you possess contact with a Wiimmfi moderator, you may directly provide them the necessary information.</p>
<h2>Mii Names and Faces</h2>
<p>Mii names and faces featuring inappropriate topics that contravene the "E for Everyone" rating will incur bans. Such prohibited content encompasses hate speech, sexual themes, derogatory language, and related material. It is crucial to emphasize that this policy does not extend to private rooms, unless a name poses a threat to a participant without their consent, particularly in Open Host rooms where unrestricted access is granted to all players. It is also worth noting that Mii names may not exceed 10 characters.</p>
<p>The utilization of the following characters in the Mii name is also prohibited to mitigate the risk of disrupting or tampering with the stats page. Their usage in friend rooms is also disallowed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ô∑Ω</li>
    <li>íê´</li>
    <li>íàô</li>
    <li>‚∏ª</li>
    <li>ÍßÖ</li>
    <br>
    <li>·Ä™</li>
    <li>‡Øµ</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> any other character not explicitly listed here that also breaks or interferes with the stats page is also subject to a ban.</p>
<p>Inclusion of hacked symbols within your Mii name will not result in a ban.</p>
<p>When reporting Mii names, it is sufficient to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, both of which are accessible via https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw. In instances where Mii names incorporate symbols not viewable on the stats page, it is advisable to provide at least a screenshot captured in-game as supporting evidence. For Mii faces, submission of either a screenshot or video proof is mandatory for the reporting process.</p>
<h2>Trolling and disruptive play</h2>
<p>Engaging in the practice of deliberately driving backwards to disrupt other players with items is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>The act commonly referred to as Stop Trolling, defined as deliberately decelerating while utilizing a power item such as a Star or Mega Mushroom to strike a player positioned behind, is permissible. This strategic maneuver serves the purpose of neutralizing potential threats, such as evading a player armed with Triple Red Shells, and is thus allowed.</p>

<p>However, repeatedly engaging in the act of Stop Trolling against a particular player over consecutive instances, deliberately reversing course momentarily to target them, or repeatedly striking an individual with a Star power-up in quick succession is prohibited.</p>

<p>Intentionally halting and/or performing bike dances before reaching the finish line in public rooms with the intention of allowing another player to secure victory are deemed disruptive behaviors and are therefore discouraged. It is advisable to refrain from engaging in such practices.</p>

<p>Engaging in intentional actions that result in losing races or disrupting the gameplay experience for others is strictly prohibited. This includes deliberately altering the standard mechanics of the game by imposing self-handicaps that ensure defeat or interfere with other players. Examples of such behavior include limiting the use of essential controller functions, playing while blindfolded, driving exclusively in reverse, or any similar actions that compromise the integrity of the game.</p>

<p>Worldwide, Regional, and CTWW races adhere to the same set of rules against trolling. However, Countdown and Battle modes feature distinct definitions, as outlined in their respective sections below.</p>

<p>To report any instance of trolling or disruptive play, it is necessary to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, accessible via <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording documenting the incident.</p>
<h2>Trolling in Countdown</h2>
<p>In Countdown mode, owing to its distinctive nature, the enforcement of trolling rules is comparatively more relaxed in contrast to standard races.</p>
<p>Reversing at the onset of a race to exploit Stars/Bullet Bills from a lap behind for trolling purposes is prohibited.</p>
<p>During the initial scrum, typically occurring at the first item set, more leniency is granted, allowing for actions such as hitting a single player multiple times with a Star, among other maneuvers.</p>
<p>While racing, the standard trolling rules generally apply; however, there are specific exceptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Slowing down intentionally to strike someone with all three of your Red Shells is permitted.</li>
    <li>In the event that you unintentionally find yourself in a situation where you have overbagged, and other racers are a lap ahead (without the deliberate act of reversing on the track), it is acceptable to target them from a lap behind in order to score more points.</li>
</ul>
<p>To report any instance of trolling in Countdown, it is necessary to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, accessible via <a href="stats/mkw">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording documenting the incident.</p>
<h2>Trolling in Battle</h2>
<p>In Battle mode, while discerning trolling behavior may be subject to interpretation, there exist certain limitations, albeit less stringent compared to VS Race or Countdown trolling:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Coin Runners, consistently targeting a player with no coins throughout the match is discouraged, as it offers no strategic advantage and may appear as trolling. However, employing this tactic moderately to deter the player from collecting coins/items is permissible, provided it is not abusive.</li>
<li>Bike dancing/wiggling is not categorized as trolling unless it becomes abusive. In Balloon Battle, celebrating a victory by bike dancing/wiggling after defeating a player with only one balloon remaining is acceptable. Nonetheless, repetitive actions may be construed as taunting, especially if the player who does so is a teammate or did not hit you, which is unfavorable.</li>
<li>Avoid sabotaging your team. Purposely underperforming to detrimentally affect a disliked teammate's Battle Rating (BR) is prohibited. Similarly, collaborating with opponents to assist them is also discouraged.</li>
<li>Prolonged periods of inactivity in the Battle arena are discouraged. Remaining stationary for extended durations renders oneself an easy target and may be perceived as sabotage against one's team.</li>
</ul>
<p>To report any instance of trolling in Battle mode, it is necessary to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, accessible via <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording documenting the incident.</p>

<h2>VR* Hacks</h2>
<h6>*Anything that applies to VR also applies to BR.</h6>

<p>Hacking your VR value above 9999 or below 1 will result in a small automatic ban by the server and is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>Maintaining your VR at a specific value throughout a Worldwide session is not allowed as it prevents the possibility of losing or gaining VR.</p>

<p>Engaging in the Road to 1 VR strategy, where a player intentionally loses every race to reduce their VR to 1, is prohibited.</p>

<p>VR levels of 3999 and below are generally viewed as suspicious since it is highly unlikely for someone to reach such low levels legitimately. This behavior may be considered disruptive play, particularly if it involves draining others‚Äô VR by winning, or if it is part of a Road to 1 VR strategy.</p>

<p>Going offline and hacking your VR to a higher value is permitted, provided that upon returning online, you remain susceptible to VR loss regardless of your performance in the races.</p>

<p>To report VR hacking, you only require the player‚Äôs Friend Code or Profile ID, which can be obtained from <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>. However, reporting deliberate VR manipulation or maintaining VR at the same value constantly necessitates providing a recording of the incident.</p>

<h2>Performing Ultra Shortcuts (Glitches)</h2>
<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> Wiimmfi no longer enforces bans on individuals attempting Ultra Shortcuts, following an update that blocked their usage. However, if new methods of glitching emerge, they will be subject to evaluation.</p>
<p>Utilizing Ultra Shortcuts on tracks is strictly prohibited. You may refer to the list of banned and allowed shortcuts by clicking on the respective tracks listed below.</p>
<p>For the regular 32 Nintendo tracks, the list of banned shortcuts are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mushroom Gorge Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>Mario Circuit Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>Coconut Mall Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>Coconut Mall Thunder Cloud Shortcut</li>
<li>Coconut Mall Wall Clip Shortcut</li>
<li>Wario‚Äôs Gold Mine Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>Maple Treeway Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>Grumble Volcano Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>GCN Peach Beach Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>SNES Ghost Valley 2 Pole Clip</li>
<li>N64 Sherbet Land Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>N64 DK‚Äôs Jungle Parkway Ultra Shortcut</li>
<li>N64 DK‚Äôs Jungle Parkway Spiral Skip</li>
<li>Rainbow Road Online Glitch</li>
<li>DS Desert Hills Backwards Strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowed <i>Glitch Shortcuts</i> Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grumble Volcano Rock Hop</li>
<li>Grumble Volcano Respawn Shortcut</li>
<li>Bowser‚Äôs Castle Glitch</li>
<li>DS Desert Hills Lake Shortcut (clip method & wall ride method)</li>
<li>GBA Bowser Castle 3 Shortcuts</li>
<li>GCN DK Mountain Glitch</li>
<li>Toad‚Äôs Factory Glitch</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other shortcut is also allowed on Wiimmfi.<br>
CTGP automatically patches out Ultra Shortcuts from online play. However, there are still several glitches that remain exploitable and may lead to bans. These glitches include*:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flowery Greenhouse Skip</li>
<li>Forest Creek Ultra</li>
</ul>
<h6>*Updated as of Sep 26, 2022 (v1.03.1136)</h6>
<p>Please note that this list may not be up to date.</p>
<p>To report any instances of using non<li>Allowed glitches, you must provide the player‚Äôs Friend Code or Profile ID, which can be obtained from <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording documenting the incident.</p>
<h2>Hacking</h2>
<p>In adherence to Wiimmfi's policies, all hacks and cheats that grant players an unfair advantage over others are strictly prohibited. Below is a compilation of the most common forbidden hacks that can lead to a ban from Wiimmfi if they are employed. Please note that while this list covers many prohibited codes, it may not be exhaustive. Therefore, if you have any uncertainty regarding a particular code not listed here, it is advised to refrain from using it.</p>

<li>Any code that sets your region or any other online parameter to an invalid one.
<li>Any code that spoofs the data that is sent to the server (such as modifying the Login Region parameter, forcing host status or hiding player data from the stats).
<li>Any code that allows the execution of code in an external console.


‚Ä¢ File modifications ‚Ä¢
<li>Any modification to any course's KMP/KCL that changes the main functions of the track's gameplay (in case of the KCL, anything that is not sound triggers, effect triggers and terrain/wall sound changes; in case of the KMP, anything that modifies check points, respawn point positions, start positions, objects the player can interact with and routes).
<li>StaticR.rel and main.dol modifications are generally forbidden if they modify anything related to the forbidden hack list, but allowed if they are for visual/audio changes that don't affect the gameplay at all (see list of allowed hacks). Any modification to StaticR.rel/main.dol that serves the main purpose of injecting cheats from the list above is not allowed.

<li>BRCTR modifications: some BRCTR files can cause button inputs to be delayed, which could cause trouble in online gameplay.
</small>

<p>In general, cheat codes that do not impact races are permissible, with a few exceptions outlined below. The following list provides examples of allowed hacks:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Cheat codes ‚Ä¢</p>
<small>
<li>Codes that change the color/texture of something, except making course/object walls invisible or items much more visible, such as see items through walls, bigger items, clearer Fake Item Boxes...
<li>Codes that change your Mii name (without impersonating anybody and without using non<li>Acceptable Mii names). Note: it is generally NOT allowed to show a different Mii name on the server status pages than on the other players' screens, including names that exceed the character limit.
<li>Codes that change CPU enemies' behavior.
<li>Codes that change your display country/flag.
<li>Codes to unlock anything in the game.
<li>Codes to navigate faster through menus.

<li>"Only search for x VR/BR worldwides" code.
<li>Change characters/vehicles between online races.
<li>Any code that affects ghost data or time trials. 
<li>Any code that affects 3D models used outside of race/battle.
<li>Any code that changes the display of effects in general, as long as it doesn‚Äôt produce lag online.
</small>
<p>‚Ä¢ File modifications ‚Ä¢</p>
<small><li>Any modification not listed in the previous lists is allowed (this can include texture hacks, music hacks, etc).</small>

<p>The use of any forbidden hacks will result in a temporary ban for a first offense, with subsequent offenses incurring more severe penalties.</p>
<p>To report instances of hacking, you must provide the player‚Äôs Friend Code or Profile ID, which can be obtained from <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording of the incident.</p>
<p>It is important to note that hacking is permissible in private rooms only if the host explicitly allows it. Otherwise, normal ban rules still apply.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wiimmfi features a specialized region known as WHackR, where hacking is permitted among players. For more information, please refer to the description of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI6ISCcq498</p>
<h2>Submitting cheated Competition times</h2>
<p>The use of any hacks, cheats, or mods that confer an advantage during Competitions is strictly prohibited. If you submit a time obtained through cheating, you will face a ban. Should your submitted time appear suspicious, you will be requested to provide evidence of your run. In cases where the time is evidently not legitimate, it will be removed from the server, and you will be banned from Wiimmfi.</p>
<p>Glitches that can be legitimately performed during Competitions are permitted.</p>
<h2>Ban Circumvention</h2>
<p>Attempting to circumvent a ban is strictly prohibited and will only result in an extension of your ban duration, potentially leading to a permanent ban from Wiimmfi. Utilizing multiple consoles to evade a ban will not be effective. If you have been permanently banned, you must follow the proper appeal process and await approval before attempting to access the platform again.</p>
<h2>Automatic Bans</h2>
<p>The Wiimmfi server and Wiimmfi Analyzer tool are utilized to enforce automatic bans, typically ranging from 3 minutes to 1 hour, with certain exceptions. Automatic bans may be issued for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid VR or BR value, exceeding 9999 or falling below 1 (resulting in a 30-minute ban, issued by the Wiimmfi server). The analyzer tool also identifies any player with a VR/BR value below 4000 for inspection and automatically issues bans for values below 1000.</li>
<li>Forbidden/disabled region (resulting in a 15-minute ban, issued by the Wiimmfi server).</li>
<li>Inappropriate or blacklisted Mii-name (resulting in bans ranging from 3 minutes to 1 hour, issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer). It is important to note that attempting to bypass filtered names may lead to longer bans.</li>
<li>Illegal (custom/modded) track (resulting in bans ranging from 3 minutes to 1 hour, issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer).</li>
<li>Illegal vehicle or driver ID (resulting in a 1-hour ban, issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer).</li>
<li>Detection of proxy, VPN, or hosting network (resulting in bans ranging from 3 minutes to 1 hour, issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer).</li>
<li>Ban circumvention (resulting in a permanent ban, issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to recognize that all automatic bans issued by Wiimmfi Analyzer are subject to monitoring. However, they may also be susceptible to errors. If you believe you have been mistakenly automatically banned, you can request a review of your case.</p>
<h2>Other Ban Reasons</h2>
<p>Several other reasons may lead to a ban from Wiimmfi. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing certain Custom Track distributions to access custom tracks in regular Worldwides.</li>
<li>Operating Dolphin emulator on Wiimmfi without a consistent framerate of 60fps.<br>
    Failure to meet this requirement may lead to a ban.</li>
<li>Experiencing severe internet connectivity issues causing teleportation across the track.</li>
<li>Encountering NatNeg issues, resulting in being kicked from a room. Enabling DMZ on your router might alleviate this problem.</li>
<li>Collaborating with someone to cheat online, regardless of direct participation.</li>
<li>Providing false evidence to accuse someone and have them banned.</li>
<li>Sharing cheating techniques that may encourage others to cheat online.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Notes:</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Wiimmfi does not guarantee protection from bans issued against players unknowingly using distributions/mods with illegal properties. Players should contact the creator of such distributions/mods if banned due to usage.</li>
<li>Moderators retain the authority to ban immediately and without notice any profile that may pose a threat to the community or other players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the lengths of a Ban</h2>
<p>The duration of bans for each offense on Wiimmfi is not standardized. Each moderator has the discretion to determine the most appropriate ban length for a given offense. Consequently, individuals may receive longer bans for similar infractions compared to others in the past.</p>
<p>Typically, minor offenses such as inappropriate Mii names or VR hacks may result in bans ranging from 1 to 24 hours, or up to 1 week in certain cases, for a first offense. Trolling offenses may lead to bans lasting up to 1 week for first-time offenders, while bans for cheating vary widely.</p>
<p>All bans are progressive, meaning the duration increases based on the severity of the offense and the number of prior infractions committed by the player.</p>
<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<p>It is imperative to refrain from insulting or harassing Wiimmfi moderators based on their decisions. Engaging in such behavior will only lead to an extension of the ban duration. Additionally, please note that the identities of the moderators are not disclosed publicly, and other moderators are not authorized to reveal who issued a specific ban.</p>
<p>If you believe you were banned erroneously, you may submit an appeal on the About banning thread located on this forum: <a>https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Board/357-Wiimmfi-English/</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring that Wiimmfi remains a safe and enjoyable experience for all users!</p>
